##mono-alphabetic substitution cipher for the alphabet of English characters A to Z 

###Continuous assessment for Week 1 - Classical Encryption/Substitution Cipher

1. Select a Wikipedia article of minimum 10,000 words as your plaintext P.

2. Decide on a simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher for the alphabet of English characters A to Z (be case agnostic) and    use it as your encryption scheme E.

3. Compute your ciphertext C as C = E(P) by encrypting only the alphabetic characters (leaving all other characters, symbols,      etc as is)

4. Compute the character frequency graph for your ciphertext C and draw it as a bar chart with x-axis in alphabetic order.

5. Identify the 5 ciphertext characters with the highest frequency and speculate on the mapping to the plaintext characters in    the alphabet.

6. Prepare a partial decryption of the ciphertext with only the identified top-5 characters replaced with their corresponding      plaintext guesses.
